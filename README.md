XGalaga JS
==========

Description
-----------

This is a JavaScript port of the famous arcade game
[XGalaga](http://rumsey.org/xgal.html) from Joe Rumsey.
On modern browsers a HTML 5 2D canvas is used for rendering. If this
feature is not available (IE7 and IE8 for example) then standard HTML
elements are used for drawing all the sprites. 

You can play the game right here:
